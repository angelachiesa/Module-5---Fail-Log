# Fail Log for Module Five
August 7th - August 13th 

--------------
###### Previous Mistakes
For whatever reason, I was unable to complete one of the exercises from last week. I did do the correct steps but it didn't work out. Hopefully it'll work out if I try to this exercise for the final project. 

I forgot to also detail in one of my blog posts reflecting on what i've learned and how I will face challenges. I will add that to this weeks blogpost. 

# Final Project
For the final project, my understanding is that we need to go through the Shawville Equity files and publish our findings through the exercises in the passed modules. I just posted on slack to make sure I understand the project before beginning. My aim is go through the fail logs I've written in the passed and create a well crafted project by using some of the examples of formatted used. I'm hoping I can make the project appealing from a graphic background. I do feel overwhelmed by how much information there is and what to do. With some help from my collegues, I'm sure I will understand further and be off to a good start. 

# Exercise 2 Week 2

This exercise is how I’m going to get the files into my dhbox, however I will only be using the 2010 file. Following this, I will go into the next exercise.
 

# Exercise 4 Week 4 
The purpose of this exercise is to go through the "Colonial Newspaper" Database and use a tool known as 'Overview'. Overview looks at how often words are used throughout the data. It will allow me and aid me in my project in regards to finding the most common topics in 2010. This will help me a lot in terms of looking at topics of conversations. Rather than having to specific using a search engine for specific words, I can try a series of words that relate to a general larger topic and I will hopefully be able to find the information and categorize it into topics. 

>Reflection
I’m hoping I can come out with a strong finish to this course. I know I just need to put in the time now and should be able to come out with a good project. I am nervous on the other exercises I haven’t tried but it shouldn’t be to bad. Looking forward to beginning right in the morning.
